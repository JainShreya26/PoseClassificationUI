What is Army Pose Classification App? 

* The application uses pose estimation technology, specifically Mediapipe, to identify and classify poses.
* It is designed to help users practice army drills, particularly those that involve specific poses such as the salute.
* The application provides automated checking of poses, allowing users to receive feedback on their form and accuracy.
* By providing automated checking, the application enables more users to practice their drills, as they do not need to rely on an instructor or partner to provide feedback.
* The application may also include video or audio feedback, allowing users to see and hear how they performed the pose.
* The application may include a library of different army drills and poses for users to practice and master.
* Users may be able to track their progress over time, allowing them to see improvements in their form and accuracy.
* The application may also include educational resources on proper form and technique for different army drills and poses.
* The application could potentially be used by the military as a training tool, as it provides a scalable and efficient way to monitor and improve the skills of soldiers in training.
